[At the beginning of this episode of The Economists](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/the-economists/%E2%80%9Cmugged-by-reality%E2%80%9D:-covid-choices-that-are-hard-to-make/13543118) there's a strong explainer of the opportunity costs of COVID-19.

## The Economic Problem

## Production Possibility Frontiers/Curve

[This explainer](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/2177/economics/opportunity-cost-definition/) is technically on Opportunity Cost, but as a PPF is simply a graphical representation of the opportunity cost of shifting resources to the satisfaction of one want to another this explainer therefore uses PPFs to explain the concept of Opportunity Cost, so it is still helpful.
[this three episode series from Econ Lowdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsQi2ipSP2c)is super duper good. Note though that episode three is more advanced than what you need to know, and Econ 3's PPFs are more microeconomic (meaning individual markets, not just growth) so you just need to say "there are now more resources than before so the line shifts outwards"
