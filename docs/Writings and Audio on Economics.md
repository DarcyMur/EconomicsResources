# Writings and Audio on Economics
## The Must Haves

Matt (and also presumably all other economics teachers because [Alan Kohler is essentially their version of god](https://twitter.com/michael_barling/status/1453583627229433862?s=20&t=Fu4wszBApPCt6FZscLr2mw)) will have undoubtly mentioned this to you but the [The Finance Report,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjnK6yX9gpU&list=PLn2RjxYNpcawXnVw1a1j4mfDDABpL8CPx) which is hosted on Mondays to Thursdays by Alan Kohler and on Fridays is usually hosted Elysse Morgan is a good watch. (Pro Tip - the abc news website version has a habit of often taking a long time (as in days) for the clip to be uploaded, but the youtube playlist is usually updated by 8 PM the night it airs) The other one that I view as a must have is [RN Breakfast's Monday Finance, which is usually hosted by Peter Ryan.](https://search-beta.abc.net.au/#/?configure%5BgetRankingInfo%5D=true&configure%5BclickAnalytics%5D=true&configure%5BuserToken%5D=anonymous-f27c1629-b28e-4fc9-a36b-ee0b96e66e22&configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=10&query=Monday%20Finance&page=1&refinementList%5Bsite.title%5D%5B0%5D=ABC%20Radio%20National&sortBy=ABC_production_all_latest) Each week on Monday Finance the host will tackle a different topic which has either been in the news, or will be in the news because we're getting that statistic later that week, with some sort of economist being the guest and being interviewed. Monday Finance is an insightful listen always, and its only around 8 minutes each week! The big issue with Monday Finance is that it does not have its own podcast feed, but is mixed into the general stories on RN Breakfast, so each week you have to search through the feed to find it. (NOTE - There are two RN Breakfast feeds: the separate segments AND the whole show, you want the former (unless you want to listed to 50 mins of radio before the segment.)) You can also listen to it live if you like, it airs at around 6:50 AM Mondays on ABC RN. **I would also say that any of the recommendations that I list below are worth listening to/reading (good and recommended are different)**

## Writers

In terms of the writings which i would recommend reading, there are two main ones: [Peter Martin’s writings in The Conversation,](https://theconversation.com/profiles/peter-martin-682709/articles) and [Adam Triggs’ writings in Inside Story (not the Channel Nine show!).](https://insidestory.org.au/authors/adam-triggs/) Both of these individuals write their works at the pitch of someone who essentially is doing High School Economics (economically literate but not an expert) so they are definitely a good read because of this (reading things like this gives you an opportunity to practise and re-enforce your knowledge of Economics so I would definitely recommend reading them (also reading them is fun!)). Others worth reading (in no particular order) include [anything which is published in the Economics and Business section of The Conversation,](https://theconversation.com/au/business) [Saul Eslake,](https://www.sauleslake.info/topics/publications/) [Jessica Irvine (the only paywalled one out of the lot](https://www.smh.com.au/by/jessica-irvine-1mfrxv) [Richard Holden,](https://theconversation.com/profiles/richard-holden-118107/articles) [Greg Jericho,](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/) [former trade minister Craig Emerson,](http://craigemersoneconomics.com/) [Ross Gittins,](http://www.rossgittins.com/) and [Alan Kohler](https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/akohler/). You may have noticed, with the exception of Jessica Irvine, that all listed are white men, and this is not without trying. While there are others like [Emma Dawson](https://www.smh.com.au/by/emma-dawson-p4yvvr) and [Angela Jackson](https://www.smh.com.au/by/angela-jackson-p4yw8g) (both paywalled) who write columns occasionally, economics is a field which is, annoyingly, [dominated by white men](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2020/jun/why-study-or-not-study-economics-a-survey-of-high-school-students.html) so there are sadly very few writers out there who are not men and publish with frequency. Furthermore, the only prominent economist who isn't white in Australia is Gabriela D'Souza, who I am a massive fan of but sadly doesn't really write columns.

## Podcasts

I would very strongly recommend listening to [The Economists](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/the-economists/) which airs on ABC RN. The Economists is hosted by the aforementioned Peter Martin, who is now a visiting fellow at the Crawford School of Public Policy at ANU and is a former economics reporter at The Age, and Gigi Foster, who is a Economics Professor at the University of New South Wales. Each week the pair will talk about a different topic, and it is always an insightful listen! The Only issue with the podcasts is that it is a limited run series, so it only airs occasionally. The other issue is that Peter Martin has an annoying habit of interrupting Gigi Foster.

Another good podcast is one out of America, [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) (you will have undoubly listed to some planet money because Matt often uses it as examples in his classes). I would however say that, while Planet Money is occasionally useful, its more just a fun listen that will foster an understanding of Economics then something which is useful like The Economists.
